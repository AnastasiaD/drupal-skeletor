drupal-skeletor
===============

A skeleton Drupal install profile to set up an appropriate layout for Myplanet's install profile development strategy, striving toward continuous delivery and great good.

Notes
-----

- Lots of empty files at the moment, and some of the scripts will need
to be tweaked to work with new directory structures that were just
improved while building the skeleton.
